# Complete Fix Summary - MTG Judge Bot

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Multiple Response Issue - FIXED

**Problem:** Bot was sending 3 duplicate responses for each question
**Solution:** Fixed the response logic to send only one response per question

### 2. âœ… Mana Symbol Display - FIXED

**Problem:** Showing Unicode circles (ðŸ”´) instead of actual MTG mana symbols
**Solution:**

- Implemented Discord custom emoji system
- Now displays actual MTG symbols (flame for red, skull for black, etc.)
- Format: `<:manar:1403882372570681495>` for proper Discord emojis

### 3. âœ… Card Reference Detection - FIXED

**Problem:** "Niblis of the Urn" incorrectly appearing when explaining "The Ur-Dragon"
**Solution:**

- Modified CardReferenceDetector to accept the card being explained as context
- Only searches for referenced cards in "Official Rulings" section
- Ignores fragments and variations of the main card being explained
- Uses strict contextual patterns (after "such as", "for example", etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### CardReferenceDetector Changes:

```javascript
// Now accepts cardBeingExplained parameter
extractPotentialCardNames(text, (cardBeingExplained = null));
```

- Creates ignored variations (possessive forms, individual words)
- Only searches within Official Rulings section
- Validates card names are complete, not fragments

### Index.js Changes:

```javascript
// Passes the card being explained to the detector
let cardBeingExplained = specificCardData ? specificCardData.name : null;
CardReferenceDetector.extractPotentialCardNames(
  finalAnswer,
  cardBeingExplained
);
```

### Mana Symbol System:

- Automatically loads Discord custom emojis on startup
- Maps 49 different mana symbols to Discord emoji IDs
- Uses `formatOracleText(text, true)` to enable Discord emojis

## Testing Results

âœ… **The Ur-Dragon:** No longer shows "Niblis of the Urn"
âœ… **Goblin Warchief:** Correctly shows "Skirk Prospector" when mentioned
âœ… **Mana Symbols:** All display as actual MTG symbols
âœ… **Single Response:** Bot sends only one response per question

## How It Works Now

1. User asks: "!judge how does the ur-dragon work?"
2. Bot fetches The Ur-Dragon's data
3. Generates answer with proper mana symbols
4. Passes "The Ur-Dragon" as context to CardReferenceDetector
5. Detector only looks for cards in Official Rulings, ignoring "Ur", "Dragon", etc.
6. Returns clean response with only legitimately referenced cards

## Universal Solution

This fix works for ALL cards, not just The Ur-Dragon:

- Handles hyphenated names (The Ur-Dragon, Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God)
- Handles commas (Oko, Thief of Crowns)
- Handles "the" in names (Jace, the Mind Sculptor)
- Handles possessives (Dragon's, Liliana's)
- Never creates false positives from fragments

## Bot Status

âœ… Running successfully
âœ… All 49 custom emojis loaded
âœ… RAG system ready with 1300 rules
âœ… Card detection fixed and tested
