## 🎮 How It Works in Discord

### Before (Unicode Emojis):

```
Goblin Warchief ②🔴🔴
Sacrifice a Goblin: Add 🔴
```

### After (Discord Custom Emojis):

```
Goblin Warchief :2::manar::manar:
Sacrifice a Goblin: Add :manar:
```

**In Discord, these display as actual MTG mana symbols!**

---

## 📊 Examples

When someone types `!judge how does Goblin Warchief work?`, the bot responds with:

```
⚖️ Judge's Ruling

Goblin Warchief reduces the cost of Goblin spells you cast by :1:.
Goblins you control have Haste ⚡.

Official Rulings:
• Goblin Warchief's effect reduces only generic mana in the cost of Goblin spells
you cast. For example, it doesn't reduce the cost of Skirk Prospector below :manar:.
```

The `:1:` and `:manar:` display as actual MTG mana symbols in Discord!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/manaSymbols.js`** - Updated to use Discord custom emojis

   - Added `discord` property to all symbols
   - Modified `convertManaCost()` to use Discord emojis
   - Updated `formatOracleText()` to use Discord emojis

2. **`index.js`** - Uses the enhanced mana symbol system
   - All mana costs now display with custom emojis
   - Oracle text automatically converted

### Key Functions:

- `manaSymbols.getDisplayManaCost(manaCost)` - Converts to Discord emojis
- `manaSymbols.formatOracleText(text)` - Formats text with Discord emojis

## 📝 Notes

- The custom emojis must remain in your Discord server for the symbols to display
- If you add the bot to other servers, you'll need to upload the emojis there too
- The bot falls back to Unicode symbols if Discord emojis aren't available
