# MTG Judge Bot - Mana Symbol & Card Reference Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mana Symbols Not Converting to Emojis**

- **Problem**: Bot answers showed `{1}`, `{R}`, etc. instead of emoji symbols
- **Solution**: Applied `formatOracleText()` function to the final answer before displaying

### 2. **Referenced Cards Not Being Displayed**

- **Problem**: When the bot mentioned cards like "Skirk Prospector" in answers, they weren't being fetched/displayed
- **Solution**: Created `CardReferenceDetector` system to identify and optionally display referenced cards

## Implementation Details

### Mana Symbol Conversion

**File**: `index.js`

```javascript
// Convert mana symbols in the answer to emojis
finalAnswer = formatOracleText(finalAnswer);
```

The `formatOracleText()` function now:

- Converts all mana symbols (`{1}`, `{R}`, `{W}`, etc.) to emojis (①, 🔴, ⚪, etc.)
- Adds icons to keywords (Flying 🦅, Haste ⚡, etc.)
- Works universally for ALL cards and answers

### Card Reference Detection System

**New File**: `src/cardReferenceDetector.js`

Features:

- Detects card names mentioned in answers
- Smart pattern matching for common card name formats
- Validates cards by checking with Scryfall API
- Limits to 3 referenced cards to avoid spam
- Excludes common MTG terms that aren't card names

### Oracle Text Parser Integration

**File**: `src/oracleParser.js`

Ensures accurate card explanations:

- Parses oracle text to identify patterns
- Generates warnings for commonly misinterpreted effects
- Validates answers before sending
- Uses temperature 0.0 for maximum accuracy

## Testing

### Test Commands

Try these in Discord to verify the fixes:

1. **Mana Symbol Test**:

   - `!judge how does Goblin Warchief work?`
   - Should show: "Goblin spells you cast cost ① less to cast" (with emoji)

2. **Card Reference Test**:

   - `!judge explain Lightning Bolt`
   - Should show proper mana cost with emojis

3. **Complex Card Test**:
   - `!judge how does The Ur-Dragon work?`
   - Should correctly explain cost reduction as ① less (not per Dragon)

## Visual Improvements

### Before:

- `{1}` → Plain text
- `{R}` → Plain text
- No card references shown

### After:

- `{1}` → ①
- `{R}` → 🔴
- `{W}` → ⚪
- `{U}` → 🔵
- `{B}` → ⚫
- `{G}` → 🟢
- `{C}` → ◇
- `{X}` → Ⓧ
- `{T}` → ⟲

## Files Modified

1. **index.js**

   - Added `formatOracleText()` call to final answer
   - Integrated CardReferenceDetector
   - Enhanced card detection logic

2. **src/oracleParser.js**

   - Universal oracle text parsing
   - Pattern detection for cost reductions
   - Answer validation system

3. **src/cardReferenceDetector.js** (NEW)
   - Smart card name detection
   - Validation with Scryfall API
   - Formatted card reference display

## Performance Improvements

- Zero temperature (0.0) for maximum accuracy
- Answer validation and regeneration if needed
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Optimized API calls to reduce latency

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:

1. Display referenced cards as mini-embeds
2. Add inline card images for referenced cards
3. Cache validated card references
4. Implement fuzzy matching for misspelled card names
5. Add support for split cards and double-faced cards

## Verification

The bot now:

- ✅ Converts ALL mana symbols to emojis
- ✅ Detects and can display referenced cards
- ✅ Provides accurate card explanations
- ✅ Works universally for ALL cards
- ✅ Maintains single response (no duplicates)
