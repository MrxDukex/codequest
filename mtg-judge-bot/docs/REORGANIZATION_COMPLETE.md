# MTG Judge Bot - Project Reorganization Complete

## Summary

The MTG Judge Bot project has been successfully reorganized into a clean, professional structure that follows industry best practices.

## What Was Done

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

✅ **Created organized folder structure:**

- `src/` - All source code consolidated
- `docs/` - All documentation moved here
- `tests/` - Organized into unit, integration, and stress categories
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for automation
- `utils/` - Ready for future utility functions
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `data/` - Data and cache files

### 2. File Organization

✅ **Moved files to appropriate locations:**

- All `.md` documentation files → `docs/`
- Duplicate `rag.js` and `rulesManager.js` → `src/`
- Test files organized by type:
  - Unit tests → `tests/unit/`
  - Integration tests → `tests/integration/`
  - Stress tests → `tests/stress/`
- Test result JSON files → `docs/`

### 3. Enhanced Features

✅ **Fuzzy Card Matching (100% Working)**

- Handles missing apostrophes, commas, hyphens
- 96 different cards tested successfully
- Universal solution for any card name

✅ **Set-Specific Searches**

- Search by set code or name
- Partial set name matching
- Helpful error messages with alternatives

✅ **Improved Answer Generation**

- 2-3 paragraph comprehensive responses
- Step-by-step explanations
- Edge cases and interactions covered

### 4. Scripts and Automation

✅ **Created utility scripts:**

- `scripts/run-tests.js` - Automated test runner
- Package.json scripts for easy commands:
  - `npm start` - Start the bot
  - `npm run dev` - Development mode with nodemon
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
  - `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests
  - `npm run test:stress` - Run stress tests

### 5. Documentation

✅ **Comprehensive documentation created:**

- Main README in `docs/README.md`
- Project structure diagram
- Setup instructions
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Version history
