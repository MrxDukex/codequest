# MTG Judge Bot - Complete Fix Summary

## Date: August 10, 2025

## All Issues Fixed ✅

### Original Problems from User:

1. **Bot giving 3 answers at the same time** - Multiple identical responses
2. **Bot not answering questions correctly** - Searching for cards instead of explaining rules
3. **Answers getting cut off** - Truncated responses with incomplete information
4. **Irrelevant rules included** - Rule 614.9 shown for unrelated questions

### 5. Accurate Interaction Answers ✅

- "How does Doubling Season work with planeswalkers?" now correctly explains:
  - Doubles loyalty counters when entering
  - Does NOT double loyalty from abilities (it's a cost)
  - Includes relevant rules and examples

## Test Results

## Priority System

The bot now uses a smart priority system:

1. **PRIORITY 1: Interactions** - Check if question is about how two things work together
2. **PRIORITY 2: Keywords** - Check if question is about a specific mechanic/keyword
3. **PRIORITY 3: Cards** - Only search for cards if not a keyword/interaction question

This ensures the bot answers what's actually being asked, not just what words it sees.

## Example Improvements

### Before:

**Question:** "How does Doubling Season work with planeswalkers?"
**Answer:** Generic explanation of what a planeswalker is + irrelevant Rule 614.9

### After:

**Question:** "How does Doubling Season work with planeswalkers?"
**Answer:**

```
Doubling Season and Planeswalkers

Doubling Season doubles the loyalty counters a planeswalker enters the
battlefield with. If a planeswalker would normally enter with 3 loyalty
counters, it enters with 6 instead.

Important: Doubling Season does NOT double loyalty gained from activating
loyalty abilities, because adding or removing loyalty counters is a cost,
not an effect.

Example: If you control Doubling Season and cast a Jace that normally
enters with 3 loyalty, it enters with 6 loyalty instead. However, using
its +1 ability still only adds 1 loyalty counter.

Relevant Rules: 614.16, 306.5b, 122.6
```
