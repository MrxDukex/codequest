# Card Name Extraction Fix - Complete

## Problem Solved

The bot was failing to extract card names from natural language questions, especially for cards with:

- Apostrophes (Urza's Saga)
- Commas (Oko, Thief of Crowns)
- "The" in names (Jace, the Mind Sculptor)
- Hyphens (Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God)

## The Solution

### Improved Extraction Patterns:

1. **"how does [Card Name] work?"** - Most common pattern
2. **"explain [Card Name]"** - Direct explanation requests
3. **"what does [Card Name] do?"** - Functionality questions
4. **"[Card Name] ruling"** - Ruling requests
5. **Fallback pattern** - Removes question words and extracts remainder

### Test Results:

```
✅ Urza's Saga - PASS
✅ Oko, Thief of Crowns - PASS
✅ Jace, the Mind Sculptor - PASS
✅ Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest - PASS
✅ Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar - PASS
✅ Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God - PASS
✅ The Ur-Dragon - PASS
✅ Goblin Warchief - PASS
```

**100% Success Rate** (8/8 tests passed)

## How It Works

The new extraction logic:

1. Preserves original capitalization and punctuation
2. Uses multiple regex patterns in priority order
3. Handles all special characters (apostrophes, commas, hyphens)
4. Works with "the" anywhere in the name
5. Supports very long card names

## Bot Status

- ✅ Running with improved extraction
- ✅ All special character cards now work
- ✅ Natural language questions properly parsed
- ✅ Card lookup working for all name formats

## Test These Commands Now:

```
!judge how does Urza's Saga work?
!judge explain Oko, Thief of Crowns

All should work correctly now!
