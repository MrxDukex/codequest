# ðŸŽ“ Quiz System Documentation

## Overview

The quiz system tests your understanding of concepts after completing milestone challenges. It ensures you're actually learning, not just copying solutions!

## How It Works

### 1. Quiz Availability

- Quizzes automatically unlock after completing required challenges
- A notification pops up when a quiz becomes available
- You can also see available quizzes on the dashboard

### 2. Quiz Structure

Each quiz contains:

- **Multiple-choice questions** - Test conceptual understanding
- **Code challenges** - Test practical skills
- **Mixed difficulty** - Covers all required challenge topics

### 3. Passing Requirements

- **Passing Score:** 70% or higher
- **XP Reward:** Bonus XP for passing (50-75 XP depending on quiz)
- **Multiple Attempts:** You can retake quizzes

### 4. Failed Quiz System

If you score below 70%:

1. âœ… You see which questions you got wrong with explanations
2. âœ… System assigns **remedial challenges** to review
3. âœ… Must complete remedial challenges AFTER the failed attempt
4. âœ… Once complete, you can retake the quiz

This ensures you actually review the material before trying again!
